# Major-Project--Final-Yr
## Topic  : Lip Reading 
By observing the movements of lips we have to predict what that person want to say.

The First task is to reduce the size of the video, beacuse the only necessary part of the image is Movement of the lips, So we have to segment only that part.
So First we will apply different kind of segmentation algorithm to segment the image
One such algorithm is  "Grab Cut Algorithm" that is available in OpenCV module in Python.
